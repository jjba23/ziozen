# Status of zzspec

Currently, zzspec is a semi-stable API, that shows much promise ðŸ˜‡.
It has already proven helpful when refactoring, even cases like big refactorings like switching to a ZIO implementation of a micro-service.

# TODO

## Unit and integration tests for Kafka Producing

## Allow "initial state" in PostgreSQL and in Opensearch more easily

## Developing benchmarking capabilities (HTTP, Kafka, IO, DB) since we test from outside should be easier

## Use more of ZIO test and its data generators
